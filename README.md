Trivia App - Solo Project from Scrimba course.

-Build with React library
- Added my own flavor with CSS

I learned a lot of the React ecosystem while building this project.
Some of the things learned:
- How to work with api's.
- How to fetch data and keep it in state.
- Incapsulation of the useEffect hook logic to use it in other components.
- Communication between components using props.
- Add animations when user interacts.
